Simulations, in Python, of Physical and Mathematical systems. I wrote them during Fall 2019 for the course "Intro to Computational Physics" and during Spring 2020 for the course "Computational Statistical Physics". Each folder contains a pdf file that contains an exercise sheet describing what type of simulation the code produce.
