Simulations, in Python, of Physical and Mathematical systems. I wrote them mainly during Fall 2019 for the course "Intro to Computational Physics". Each folder contains two pdf files. The file called "ex_XY"  contains an exercise sheet describing what type of simulation the code produce. The pdf called "report" shows the results of my simulations.
