Simulations, in Python, of Physical and Mathematical systems. I wrote them during Fall 2019 for the course "Intro to Computational Physics" and during Spring 2020 for the course "Computational Statistical Physics". Each folder contains two pdf files. The file called "ex_XY"  contains an exercise sheet describing what type of simulation the code produce. The pdf called "report" shows the results of my simulations.
